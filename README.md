Scarface Framework
​Social Engineering & Security Assessment Suite
​Overview
​Scarface Framework is a specialized security toolkit designed for authorized red teaming, social engineering simulations, and security awareness training. It consolidates the workflow of security assessments into a unified environment, allowing professionals to test organizational resilience against phishing and web-based attacks.
​The framework provides a streamlined interface for replicating web assets, hosting simulation servers, designing educational lures, and delivering email campaigns to authorized test groups.
​Key Features
​🌐 High-Fidelity Site Replication
​The framework includes an advanced cloning engine capable of replicating target web pages with high accuracy. It automatically handles asset retrieval (CSS, JavaScript, Images) and rewrites relative paths to ensure the replicated site renders correctly in an offline or local environment. This feature is essential for creating realistic scenarios for user awareness training.
​📡 Local Server Hosting & Tunneling
​Scarface simplifies the deployment of simulation servers. It can host replicated sites locally using lightweight web servers (Flask/PHP) and supports integration with standard tunneling services. This allows security testers to expose local environments to external test subjects securely and temporarily during an engagement.
​📝 Dynamic Template Generation
​The template engine allows operators to create and customize HTML email templates. It supports dynamic variable insertion, enabling the creation of personalized security alerts, notifications, or internal memos used to test user vigilance. The system ensures templates are formatted correctly for modern email clients.
​📧 Campaign Delivery System
​An integrated SMTP client manages the distribution of assessment emails. It supports custom SMTP configurations, bulk recipient processing, and HTML body injection. This feature ensures that test emails are delivered efficiently to the scope of the assessment, facilitating large-scale security drills.
​📊 Data Capture & Logging
​The framework features a robust logging system that records interactions with the hosted simulations. It captures form submissions and access logs, providing detailed reports on user interactions. This data is crucial for generating post-assessment reports and identifying areas where security training is needed.
