- ✅ Automatic credential harvesting injection  
- ✅ Server deployment (PHP and Flask)  
- ✅ Real-time credential monitoring  
- ✅ Multiple tunneling options  

### Smart Injection System
- ✅ JavaScript injection for HTML sites  
- ✅ PHP code injection for PHP-based sites  
- ✅ Automatic backup of original files  
- ✅ Injection markers to prevent duplicates  

### Flexible Deployment
- ✅ Localhost testing  
- ✅ Cloudflared tunneling  
- ✅ Ngrok integration  
- ✅ LocalTunnel support  
- ✅ Mobile-responsive viewport injection

## 🌐 Tunneling Options Comparison

| Feature         | Ngrok | Cloudflared | Localtunnel |
|----------------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Best for**   | Quick demos | Longer testing | Instant testing |
| **Setup**      | Easy | Moderate | Easiest |
| **Stability**  | 2hr limit | Very stable | Unstable |
| **Account**    | Required | Required | Not needed |

### Quick Decision Guide:
1. **Need it working right now?** → Localtunnel  
2. **Need to show someone for a few hours?** → Ngrok  
3. **Need it stable for days?** → Cloudflared

## 💉 Injection System
The framework includes an automated injection mechanism that:
- Adds credential capture functionality to cloned sites  
- Works with both static HTML and PHP sites  
- Preserves original site functionality  
- Stores captured data securely  
- Leaves minimal forensic traces  

All injections are designed to be:
- 🔄 Reversible (original files are backed up)  
- ⚖️ Ethical (includes usage warnings)  
- 🔍 Transparent (clearly visible in testing scenarios)  

## 🛠️ Usage
Scarface is designed for authorized security testing and educational purposes. To use the framework:

1. Clone the target website using the built-in cloner  
2. Deploy the cloned site using your preferred tunneling method  
3. Monitor captured credentials through the dashboard  
4. Always ensure proper authorization before testing  

**Remember**: This tool should only be used on systems you own or have explicit permission to test.
